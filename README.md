# W1P1-JS

Write a JavaScript program that asks the user to enter their name
and their age. If the user is older than 18, output a message that they
are old enough to apply for a car driver license. If the user is 17 years
old, the output message must show that they can only apply for
a car learner license. If the user is younger than 17 years of age, the
output message must show that the user canâ€™t apply for a learner or
driver license yet.
